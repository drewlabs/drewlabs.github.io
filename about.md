Drewlabs was started back in 2017 by few students from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee with a vision of solving industrial problems, involving student community.

Most of the projects are the problems that students seen while working on internship in the industry whereas some active projects are research oriented.

We have a clear vision for Drewlabs that `It should always get maintained and organized by students, having zeal to shape innovative solutions for industry and academic research.`
